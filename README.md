## Cambridge ALTA Machine Learning Resources

Welcome to our webpages about machine learning!

We plan to fill this repository with useful information about current theory and methodology in machine learning. The idea is for this to be a group exercise starting at the ML Bootcamp at the Triangle, 24 September 2019.

Contents:
- this
- will
- be
  - filled out during the day

To contribute:
1. get invited to the [CambridgeALTA](https://github.com/CambridgeALTA) organisational account (ask Paula, Andrew C, Ahmed, Russell)
2. navigate to the [MachineLearning](https://github.com/CambridgeALTA/MachineLearning) repository and [create a new file](https://github.com/CambridgeALTA/MachineLearning/new/master) (with suffix .md) or [edit this one](https://github.com/CambridgeALTA/MachineLearning/edit/master/README.md) (i.e. make sure this page links to your new one, which you'll find at https://cambridgealta.github.io/MachineLearning/NAME-OF-YOUR-NEW-PAGE).
3. check out your new page on [GitHub Pages](https://cambridgealta.github.io/MachineLearning)

See an [example markdown page](https://github.com/CambridgeALTA/MachineLearning/blob/master/example.md) and [rendered page](https://cambridgealta.github.io/MachineLearning/example) from that file.
