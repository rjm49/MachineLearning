### Cambridge ALTA Machine Learning Resources

Welcome to our webpages about machine learning!

We plan to fill this repository with useful information about current theory and methodology in machine learning. The idea is for this to be a group exercise starting at the ML Bootcamp at the Triangle, 24 September 2019.

Contents:
- this
- will
- be
  - filled out during the day

*Please note that this is a public repository and public webpage.*
