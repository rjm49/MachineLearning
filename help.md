## Writing markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for document formatting as in the following examples.

```markdown
Note that this is a code block (enclosed by triple backticks).
Include inline code with single backticks `like this`

You can also make text **Bold** or _Italic_ 

Headers and lists
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List
```


### Tables

```markdown
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
